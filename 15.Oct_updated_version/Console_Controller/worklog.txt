This is only the draft version, and 7 things need to be announced.

1. There will be not {r_readyfix, s_readyfix, c_readyfix: Nat;} anymore, instead, we use {readyfix_req: Nat;}. The reason is that {s_readycheck, r_readycheck, c_readycheck: Nat # Bool;} has the capability to check it.
2. {s_check_off, r_check_off, c_check_off: Nat # Bool;} and its corresponding internal action(s) will be deleted, because they are redundant when I implement the functions.
3. For the altitude checking, "true" represents breaching the atmosphere while "false" represents not breaching.
4. For the fuel checking, "true" represents not depleted while "false" represents depleted.
5. OM owns an engine (see step 5 and figure 1)
6. There should have an assumption for step 6 --> predefined interval = the depleting time of fuel, then we can use fuel_check to determine the correct timing for the detachment. 
7. I believe this version is not the final one, so do not hurry to merge your code with it. 

I saw all the controllers have been finished coding which meant that we had made great progress in so far. (y)

Wish all of you have a nice weekend!
